# Task 1: software configuration.
## “Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?”
I really want to change the field of activity. I participate in the project to learn something new and gain new knowledge in the field of testing. I expect from the course interesting tasks, new acquaintances and the possibility of employment in the field of IT.

__I hope that I will succeed.__ 😊
